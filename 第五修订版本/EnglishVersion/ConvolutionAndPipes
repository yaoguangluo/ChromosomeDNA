About the prefix convolutional computings, LWA (from left to the right, or from head to the tail),
the author did a first conference at Shanghai Electrics, China, about the Butterworth lowpass and
Sawtooth wavelet. Then did a fulfillment of convolutional vision at callutheran, USA. The author
considered not only the prefix convolutional computings, the Arabic postfix RWA (from right to the
left, or from tailto the head) also could be well in the wavelet.

2019-06-23 Author's notes on Gitee. 2006, Nanjing, the author first touched the Fourier's formula
set AcosB+BsinA where in his bachelor's class of High Frequency Circut, HFC wavelet. At 2007, the
author learned a derivation of AcosB and AsinB collections where in REVA institute. Bangalore University.
And got LRC formula of
Ui(t)= L*di(t)/dt+ 1/C*df i(t)*dt + R*i(t) with L*C*d*d*U0*(t)/dt*dt + R*C*d*U0(t)/dt + U0(t), 
at Christ University, 2009. Then made a presentation of Fourier's transformation wavlet at KaiTong Ltd,
Shanghai. After got a few experiences of frequent wavelet, the author continued a fulfillment of
convolutional computer-vision at USA, and tested FFT and DCT sound communications at Liuyang, 2014~2015.
Finally try to make an analyst of dyslexia-brains and partner with Sir. Newton Howard at Oxford University, UK.

Once done of the Deta Parser at 2019, the Author considered a VPCS could make a differential and
integration in the same time. It was a symmetric statement. And the DNA sessional encription was 
the same too, for example the differential PDE -> PDS and an integration of PDS -> PDE. The author
considered it could be used in parallel RNA IC design.

Implements of non convolutional vision-computings. The Author considered a convolutional matrix
of kernel, was a centre of computing, meant the scale size was 3, then will do 3* 3= 9 calculations
by each set. If the scale size was 4, meant to do 4 * 4=16 times. so the formula was M sets * O(N*N).
Therefore, the author considered a non convolutional algorithms were needed by todays. For example 
of DNA non-convolutional vision-computings.

Implements of convolutional wavlet-component by Etl Unicorn.

Once done of computer vision of 2012, the Author considered it could work as an Etl pipe node, 
then built an Unicorn vision tools. Then integrated a java sound API, the below pictures did a well 
show of the proofs. For example a max-min node pipes to the propotion-taylor node, to perform a 
heartbeats filter.
