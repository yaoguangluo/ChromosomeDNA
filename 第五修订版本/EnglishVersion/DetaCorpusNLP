Deta literatural analyst which was based on Orthos map and loxical dictionary. Before the word segmential process
of essay, the Deta parser engine will init an indexed base where could store the reflectional chars set of an 
observation. Then input strings to do the word segmentation. The Deta engine could sequently parser the word correctly,
which was based on this corpus by finding key values of map. Then did an exhibition of resultant statistics. For

trends to an argumentation and statement, is 0.47368 and 0.40983. Recently Deta NLP algorithms could make a sustainable 
optimization by increasing more componients of filters, determinations, definitions, PCA and artical types.
