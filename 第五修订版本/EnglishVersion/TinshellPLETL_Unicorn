Implements of ETL Unicorn and PLETL nodes.
At the beginning, the author made an ETL node which almost similar with the Knime node, because the 
Knime node is a standard ETL node(with orange, WEKA, oracle, kettle and etc are almost the same) 
which contains an operating UI. Based on this self UI, the user could do more interactions between 
ETL nodes and assignments. for example, Knime user uses the SWT techneology to build all kinds of 
the procedure UI by using the Knime of eclipse plugin SDK. Once the Tinshell script was build, the 
author thought it could be intergrated in the ETL work flows such as PLETL, thus, each Tinshell 
ETL could only have had one type of procedure UI, which means Tinshell UI-- A top Text input for 
scripting Tinshell commands, and a bottom Text output for responding results of Tinshell executions. 
The author once said: all of ETL node UI could be the same type as Tinshell node in the future AI.
