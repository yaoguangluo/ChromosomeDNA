Definition: Deta parser word segmentation is a word cutting engine where based on the index forest dictionary
of the neural network map, which carries out the word association cutting, and then circulating the traversal
function of the part of speech(POS) combination matching, and defines the collocation according to the Chinese
literary grammar. 

1 The index dictionary can accelerate the refinement and splitting. The refinement differentiation can effectively 
reduce the memory operation volume and the occupation of resources, so as to improve the current stack search
and operation speed. 

2 The function can accelerate the optimization of the frequency’s usage and statistical arrangement. Once the function
has the high-frequenct advance operation, meant it has a queue-priority consciousness and can be metabolized here. For example,
the higher frequency logic sections could be arranged at the top by using Sequences of Von-Neumann(from top to
bottom, from left to right). 

3 The total number of dynamic convolution kernels is directly related to the computational complexity. The more
complex the computation is, the higher the cost will be. Of course the higher the time cost will be, the adaptive
accuracy will also be improved accordingly. 

4 Functional prototypes and function file names are metabolized, and the secondary metabolism is optimized to 
accelerate index encoding. The more detailed the function, the more concise the logic, the more uniform the unit 
call calculation, and the more organized the balanced operation. 

5 The refinement and optimization of literary lexical functions are accelerated. The literary lexical problem 
is more targeted.



Deta parser, a sentence and word segmentation marching tool(NERO-NLP-POS), was based on an in-order sequence 
verbals computation, the computer monitors the humanoid specification, to read articles, sentences by each word
one by one as the river flows, then cuts the word link list by using stop method such as the index length recognizing,
word dictionary marching, then extract the pre-materials for the continuing POS(part of speech) process.

At the first. The author build a lot of association maps and classification sets, which did a nice verbal data storage
of all kinds of the literacy otho corpus(NERO), for instance, POS maps, word length maps and word type maps, 
to better catalyz the system tunning accelerations.

Each lexical map could make a combination and classification definition, the author uses the StringBuilder function
to do the word segmentation by non-conventional differently kernel computations. Like the water sequence flows from 
top to bottom, from left to right, then gather statistics of the frequency prototype usages, makes queue optimizations at the same 
time catalyzed the system tunning accelerations.

The word segmentation and Its POS cut ways by following 4 Chinese chars words, 3 chars words, 2 chars words to loop 
check the POS lexical dictionary map storages. Kernel computations work for finding a marching verbals word, then 
return the response to the NLP engine.


The ordinary model of the Deta catalytic sorting function was based on the quicksort 4D theory- Sir Charles Antony
Richard Hoare, the author refers a book <Introduction to Algorithms> here.  Since YaoguangLuo had monitored the 
java‘Quick_4D_Sort’source code and executed it successfully in computer IDE, then has been optimizing its sort logic
since 2013. The recent version of the source code is TopSort5D. and the optimization way of the arrangement sort
includes defect peak avoiding, tunning the constant values, balancing the computing sets and the discrete conditions
differentiations(Demorgan, Frequency flows etc). and now those things widely were used in Deta’s catalytic family
technology community (parser, word segments, mindreading, NLP computing etc).


Nero Network Index Forest

1 Deta Parser did a word segment indexed map by using humanoid speech verbal dictionary, for the reason why using
JDK8+ tool to do the map search logic, is that it had already integrated the binary search tree, balanced map tree
arrangement and other technologies.  

2 Deta Parser’s balanced binary search tree method makes an observer mode of averaged classification with all types
of the reflection java concurrent maps, those maps include the char word length, verbal types and Part of speech 
corpus, etc. The author did it to accelerate the NERO marching speed for searching the words. 

3 Deta Parser supports the secondary indexing computing combinations, this way could be suitable for the distributed 
cache searching systems. The author does not suggest this technology be used on a single desktop.  

4 For the computing logic, Finally Deta Parser functions use string builder to accelerate the searching engine.


The accomplishment of the neural network index is mainly reflected in two sections, 1, the relevance index of word 
segmentation and 2, the lexical index map. The associated relevance index value of word segmentation is mainly reflected 
in the chained extraction of words. This chained calculation method effectively correlates the relatively independent of
a large number of words in the thesaurus, according to the Thimble Theory in human language and Literature (Nero). T
he value of the big data document process splits the word chain links list into a small chars token(max 4) sections, 
and It is similar to squeezing toothpaste, and brushing the teeth (POS) when squeezed out by the DetaParser marching engine.

The index value of the lexical map is mainly reflected in the reasonable chain segmentation of lexical characters. This
chain of word segmentation method combines and matches the classified maps in the thesaurus according to different attributes.
And then separates them according to the rigorous definition of lexical POS and SVO collocation in human literature languages.
The adaptive industrial system design and diversified expansion of this classification, would increase the accuracy and 
flexibility of word segmentation and adapt to different segment scenes. Similar to the way of toothbrushes, the extruded 
toothpaste is matched to adapt to different oral cavity environments according to different toothbrushes and brushing methods
(Nero + POS).


The Deta Parser word segmentation and its applications in the linear text document environments.
1 There has a lot of rights weight by each indexed map, based on those right weights, Deta Parser did a marching score 
system to do the computation and calculation for the Chinese word segmentation logic.

2 the search weight of the computing logic, such as Subject Predicate Object(SVO), and part of speech(POS), for instance, 
noun, verb, adjective etc. 

3 to make a computing acceleration, the author injected a combination factor in the marching logics, such as bit calculation, 
frequency statics and word length observations. similars with the theory of Count Down Latch and Cyclic Barrier logic (makes 
definitions first then proves, or proves first then did a conclusion) ways etc 

4  Above all things and logic once became JAVA transportations, the author set all global and local valuable scales to build
the Foolishman- Self-Controller components to make the algorithms easy and simple.


Dynamic River Flows Gate Function Marching and Circustantly Loop the POS Kernel Computing.
1 Dynamic kernel contains prefix and postfix two types can read the word token one by one. It does dynamic computing also
at the same time.

2 prefix kernel stores a POS cache buffer by each current word piece of information such as positions, frequency etc, to 
accelerate the word marching.

3 Postfix relevant to the optimization of word marching and segmentation.  For example, checking the conjunction relationship 
and continuing the word token link list.

4 The algorithms kernel uses StringBuilder to do higher computing affections according to computer language grammar.


POS function gate river flows and their relationships. For example, the author did the word segmentation by using '如果是非常理想'
in this sentence. At the first through the indexed forest map dictionary, Deta Parser could cut '如果是非常理想' into ‘如果’, 
‘是非常’, ‘理想’those three associated chars word sets token list. And in this result list, ‘如果’and‘理想’ these two lexical words
seems to be immutably boned. ‘是非常’was a three chars word token then did an inner marching computing by using POS function gate
river flows theory. and at this time, the orthos corpus map base of the author's Deta Parser system which could not find any 
verbals such as‘是非常’, then continued do the two chars marched for the next step. About more powerful of these algorithms, was
the Chinese chars literacy grammar marching system, for the chars segment section, ‘是非常’did a separation into two types such 
as ‘是非-常’ and ‘是-非常’, then analyzed contrast and distinguishment by these two segments. after analysis of each word and its
prefix and postfix, POS combined relationships, （the prefix token of‘是非’was‘如果’, the prefix token of‘非常’was‘是’, the prefix 
tokens of‘常’were‘是非' and‘非’, and the prefix tokens of '理想’were‘常’and‘非常’）. This POS word segmentations theory was fixedly 
and immutably, which means it should not contain any probability events here. if at this time the DetaPaser does not find any 
associated chars relationships, then promoted to the next steps as reading cutting sequence list chars single one by one. Above all,
the result of the sample graph did a good show that DetaParser did a ‘如果-是-非常’response because the priority of Conjunction- Adj,v- Adj,v 
is higher than conjunction- noun- adj,v.
