The way of metabolism about the inherits interfaces. The author enjoyed 
a good fulfillment of the C foundation. Because of the separation of macro
types and prototypes by using C, the ordinary separation of controller 
and performance was based on this theory. Recently became a more popular
way of coding the Java Backend transactions. To better inject this theory
into the indexing initons, the author synchronized a process of files 
and functions, those files continuing that were defined and separated
into a small and single segments list, then prove that the functions
name could be an extension of filenames. at the same time, those files
and functions names with their prototypical sections also can make
a logical separation between controlling and executing. finally, 
the files name could be longer and more, and the function name could 
be smaller and less. the observation and implementation of this model
which seems like functions were hanging on the filename trails, similar 
to the blessing Dandelion flower. the author found two catalytic ways of
software metabolism. the one result for functional logic prototype metabolism
and another for indexing Metabase-intions metabolism.
