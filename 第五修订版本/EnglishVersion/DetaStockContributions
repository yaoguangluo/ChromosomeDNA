Implements of stock manipulations. The author did a matrix observation by each
tupe line of stock data, meant row by row observations. These data onto the '雪球',
'新浪' and '财富' etc, and these feedbacks on post encoding and decoding were
different with each other. For example GBK, GB2312 and UTF8 etc. The author needed 
a DataSwap of unifying. Because of the double values of a deversity-demostributions,
so the author did a mean-ratio finds, statistics, bayesian and other simple procedures
to fulfill the requirements of fund frequently inflows about trading volumes.
Then the author used FFT to make a frequency domain of transformations. According
to to trace a ten banker and informations about big deal of traders. 

Contributions to the world.
The author found a defect of feature, he made a fifteen and thirty days calculations
about inflows and outflows, which as ratio units by each stock, then distinct 
the pre-day ratio, this ratio, and post-day ratio, to find theirs 3 ratios assessment
of funds increment and decrement. The author found these ratios did a defect show 
of the day before a day was commonly, but the day was surges, and the day after
tomorrow was slipping. And its 3 ratios assessment mark, was likes '-+-' (decrement,
increment, decrement). Then the author used Wechat of sweet00048 bind of '15116110525'
to publicly issue this problem of 2018~2019.
