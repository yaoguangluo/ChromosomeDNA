Implements of PLSQL compiler, notes on Gitee, 2019-08-20.
The author did well foundament of MCU of 89C51 after 2006 (NAA), an Adv MCU of 8085 and Operating
system at 2008~2009 (Chrit University), MCU of 485 and Propller (Tyco, 2009) MCU of 28XX at 2010
(Shanghai Electric), and MCU of Stamps (Javline, Basic and Propeller, Callutheran) at 2012~2013.
Seem cool about this domain, the author then did experience in 386ASM and Plan9 by using Go, Jvm
natives read images, and call jumps simulation of compile-stacks. He considered the traditional
compile map of Program-> Structs-> Binary code-> Execution (PSBE), which could be in fact the map
of Program-> Sequenced list of functional classes-> Classes translation-> Schedure plans-> Binary
code-> Execution (PSCSBE). After a truly proof of Deta PLSQL, he considered PSCSBE could be used 
in the Creative Languages.
