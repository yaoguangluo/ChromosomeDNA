A Time Locus of Speed Fissile TSP about Ouler Forest  
The Author did a sixth foundation of Discrete Mathmatics in a college time by following Father of Christ, 
Dr. Joseph Varghese. Before he went to Folsom Intel, he had finished a simple Ouler TSP Algorithm to deal
with the coordinates which amount less than 23 coords, then made an optimiziation which promoted to 49 coords.
Once the Deta Fissile Algorithm was build, the author thought that made a separation of those coordinates 
by a long distance firstly, then did a Deta Fushion Algorithm by a short distance, and then made an Ouler
TSP connections based on short distance, and finally made an Ouler TSP connections based on long distance.
It seems like a Ouler Forest, and the inner short TSP distance groups such as tree clusters.
