Implements a visual ETL pipes.
At the first, we might input a picture with authors portrait, to do the visual ETL pipes. Due 
to the catching with a lower scaled camera, so that the picture was not clearly, meant a little 
bit dark and fussy on it. Then the author started a stretching procedure to make it more distinct,
for example stretched the pix, which ranged from '0~255' to '20~230', then he got a distinct 
picture, and continued to do a guassian procedure to make it frequently and smoothly. Finally 
did a Sobel mask procedure with Mag and Dir. The gradiant output of gray and white, where could 
be a 3 dimentional feature as an input array-value of Emboss procedure. This visual ETL pipes
could prove that It widely was used in the real word and around the industries. The author
appreciated his well education at CLU, and enjoyed his computer vision class from his teacher
Dr.Reinhart.
He also had finished all of his Database homework of UC questions by his own abilities from
his CLUs Database class.
