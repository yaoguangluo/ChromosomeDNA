ANN
DetaParser ANN computing. It mainly contains a mind set, environment set, motivation set, 
emotion set and etc. those sets were computed as a advanced decision, which emphasising 
weights as a comprehensive of trending, continuing, predicting, guessing and minding etc. 
With associating in text mining and analysis domain. either this decision will value a 
truly estimation, or will caculate a summing centre for the next steps.

RNN
DetaParser RNN computing. It mainly contains a distance set and entropia set etc. those 
sets were computed as observer weights of Part of Speed POS, Covex of position and Euclid 
KNN. With associating in text mining and analysis domain. It could clearly find out an 
information by each of lexical, such as the frequency count, ruly distribution and trace 
weight. Above sets could make a good implementation of summing centre for the next steps.

DNN
DetaParser DNN computing. It mainly contains DetaParser ANN and DetaParser RNN, for the
prefix Cartesian calculations. Due to the inputs were two types of ANN summing and RNN 
position weights, thus, DetaParser DNN could dig a central Theory of the text document, 
especially suitable for the text mining system.
