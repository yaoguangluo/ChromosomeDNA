This monograph contains a more detailed description of the computer software source code about the research
development and implementation process, from a simple mechanical coding according to the engineering logic 
function, then performs gradually to serialized genetic memory index coding and finally can carry out metabolic
optimization of the evolution.

Thus first six chapters are the Author's engineering application practice in the field of big data computing, 
importantly based on the medical big data search and analysis works by integrating YangLiaoJing(YLJ) software
development, such as word separations, object array sorting, ETL node workflows and pipeline calculations,
VPCS server scheduling algorithms, programmable database and PLSQL database language. Therefore, the Author 
conducted a good induction and follow-up research and development, gradually updated and optimized, those
fantastic job tasks eventually promoted the works of mind-reading, word segmentation, searching and indexing, 
linear convolution computation, ETL engine, PLORM database language works on VPCS scheduling. Fast structural 
transformation and combination of data variables works, as well as nonlinear data coordinate trajectory 
prediction work.

The current six API software works are constantly optimized, upgraded and improved in the flowing middle
three chapters, Author starts to think about how to effectively organize and summarize the hundreds of thousands
of source code lines were contained in these works, in order to facilitate and optimize the author's own mode
of behavior and labor. Thus, an effective and concise function classification method is born here. The semantic
meta-initions encoding specification, which the author used in the argument on the biochemical encoding, 
truly matched and deduced the complete semantic meta-base INITON (Init Aton). The peptide extending formula
PDE(PDN Extension) and the Decoding between Initons and DNA, begin to index all the functions of the YLJ
through the basic coding, and everything goes naturally. Open the world's first gate about the software
logic base on catalytic semantic DNA index coding.

In the continuing seven chapters, because of the discovery of meta-base(Init Aton, Initons) DNA encoding,
formula (PDN Extension, PDE) and decoding, the author has sufficient conditions to start integrating his
own six software works for continuous and tenacious application calculation optimization and has gained a
lot of experience on this domain. Such as the optimization of rapid word segmentation to the present peptide
exhibition(PDE) index word segmentation and the progress of metabolism; Such as quickly array sort to the
present PDE index metabolically optimized image and deed mixed string sort works; Such as convolution computing
to the present non-convolution peptide corrosion speed visual computing and image recognition works; 
Such as ETL Unicorn to now PLETL Chinese Tinshell neuronal language simulation compiler works; Such as VPCS
PLSQL database to the present PDE data meta base encryption, meta base compass word, VPCS Web Session Token 
probability encryption application; Such as data transformation to the present Tinshell, TinMap and the stack
analysis and design of instruction record structure in the meta-base flower component; Such as data prediction
to the current meta-model-based hexadecimal encode specification. etc. Open the gateway of scientific expansion
with computing across database RNA physical hardware and biochemical pheromone.

These functions and technologies are perfectly reflected in the works of YLJ and have been further tested
and optimized. The author proves out:

In the evolutionary domain of software computation, the DNA catalytic and the PDN metabolic is an effective 
evolutionary method where based on indexing optimization by humanoid INITONS (16 Init-Atons, AOPM VECS IDUQ TXHF).
