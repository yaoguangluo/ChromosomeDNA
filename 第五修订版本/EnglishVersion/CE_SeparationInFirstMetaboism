A Detail of CE Separation in First Metaboism.

At first I input a functional file name as 'AOP.MVE.CSI.DUQ.java', the meta-based initons were from 'AOPM-VECS-IDUQ, 
DNA Initon Encoding'. Assume above java file which has had three function prototypes of AOP(), AOP.MVE() and CSI(). 
then starts a metabolic optimization by their inherited interfaces. If we had learned C programming, will easy to make 
a separation between interfaces and prototypes. In an observation of metabolism, interface could be a macro type, 
and prototype could be a functional type. So by following C programming theory, we build Controller- C as marco type 
and Execute- E as functional type, it seems like a well condition of cuting the part of function name into file name 
after DNA Initon Encoding. And finally seems more like an blooming Dandelion flower. The author named this action as 
XCDX tail - first chars of 'XinChenDaiXie', metabolism. The first two line determinate a metabolic way of XCDX. And 
the end line did a comprehensively condition of static type.
