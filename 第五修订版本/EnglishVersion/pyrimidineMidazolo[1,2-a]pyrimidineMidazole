Derivation of pyrimidineMidazolo[1,2-a]pyrimidineMidazole

About Derivation about 'S-arc' shape of 'AOPM-A, LTA', 'AOPM-O, UCLA', 'AOPM-P, UCLG',
'AOPM-M, GA', 'AOPM-OP-T, LTUCL', and 'AOPM-OP-X, LTG'.

First from the mentioned page of 152, A 分析(LTA 变胸腺腺苷), O 操作(UCLA 尿胞变腺苷), 
P 处理(UCLG 尿胞变鸟苷), M管理(GA 鸟腺苷), V 感知(LT 变胸腺嘌呤), E 执行(UCL 尿胞变嘌呤),
C 控制(G 鸟嘌呤), S 静态(A 腺嘌呤), I 增加(U 尿嘧啶), D 减少(C 胞嘧啶), U 改变(L 变嘧啶),
Q 感应(T 胸腺嘧啶).

D-Decrement(C-Cytosine Initon), U-Update(L-Yaoguang Initons), Q-Query(T-thymine Initon).

A spiral trigger flip-flops and its catalyic observation. Once the author did a proof about
PDN extension formulas of A= V+S, O= E+ S, P= E+ C, M= C+ S.It could be concluded as A equals
to two purines combined by V and S, then did an observation of this structure of A Initon, 'A'
might contain Hybrogen-ion, Oxide-ion and Nitride-ion. Then did a proof of its real world sample.
Finally proved a pyrimidineMidazolo[1,2-a]pyrimidineMidazole, was a common Initon's structure 
of A,O,P,M,T and X. Initially he found out four potiencial structures, which need be calculated
of what was a true, and these proofs need by following an ordinary provided sources, 1 Nitride-parts
position couldn't be changed of where in Midazolos, 2 It might need TWO fully pyrimidines to 
do a DNA base par connected conditions, to distinct the 'Steroid's which only had one base par 
connected conditions, not two. Finally the author did a structure of pyrimidineMidazolo[1,2-a]pyrimidineMidazole,
which resonated with author's thinking. and now these definitial structures catalyzed a 
three-Initon-char-code-node of PDC and PDW encodings. For example AOP.POM.VEC. etc.

The author connected his human literatural structures where learned at school, for example SVO
of subjects, predicates, and objects. He considered the DNA should had its own literatural branches
(Nouns, Verbs and Advebs). Because the SVO could support structure of Nouns, Verbs and Advebs, 
or a structure of Nouns, Adjectives and gerund, those three-Initon-char-code-node of PDC and PDW
encodings sample, see the original page of 150, 153 and 154,
