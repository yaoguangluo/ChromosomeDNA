Definition of software metabolism, determinated a theory of evolutionary and catalytical optimizations of its prototypes,
interfaces, macros and logic code contents, for instance, their classifications, inherits, arrangments and reallocations.
those metabolic optimizations were based on the software and its programmable files.

Definition of software secondary metabolism determinated a theory of evolutionary and PDN extension (PDE Encoding)
optimizations of each indexed file name and its function names, for instance of the meta Initon's PDE swap(AOPM -> VECS-> IDUQ), 
PDS(IDUQ -> VECS -> AOPM) swap and PDC encrypt(humanoid languages -> initons encoding languages ). And those instances 
could combinate an action of the first software metabolism at the same time.
