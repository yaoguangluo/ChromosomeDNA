About a speed Chinese search algorithm.
It mainly was integrated in YangLiaoJing(YLJ) engine system. As an important component, 
the algorithm contained two parts of searching, were content and subject. First, talked 
about searching of content, It included the way of word segmentation and statistics, for
instance key word, frequency word, word length, parts of speech and etc. Finally built a
responding map for feeding a functional call back. Then talked about searching of subject,
It could be a Text file, strings document, DNN minds stream, then did a marching score 
before a searching of content. The way of marching could be POS(Part of Speech), 
NLP(Nature Language Process), PCA (Primary Componient Analysis) and etc. Then output a 
final result after sort and arranged conclusions. Seen the engine might add more scales
of the self-control in the industrial environment.
