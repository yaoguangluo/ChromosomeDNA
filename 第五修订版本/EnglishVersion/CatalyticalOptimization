Definition of Catalytical Sort

Definition of Catalytical Sort, in the tranditionary and ordinary processing of array sorting, 
Catalytism means a balanced peak avoid of RAM computing, means a Catalytical theory of reducing 
the ALUs, valuable sets, conditions, logic sections, function calls and prototypes.
The Accomplishment of Catalytical theory is an insufficiently condition to the next two steps 
of software DNA metabolism of functional logic and PDE(PDN Extension) secondary metabolism of 
metabase Initons encoding.

For proofs, TopSort5D
reducing the ALUs, Digital logics.
reducing the valuable sets, Memory optimizations.
reducing the conditions, Demorgan mathematics.
reducing the logic sections, Discrete mathematics.
reducing the function calls, Recuisive logics. Priority calls the high frequency logic sections as river flows.
reducing the prototypes. Inheritation logic.
