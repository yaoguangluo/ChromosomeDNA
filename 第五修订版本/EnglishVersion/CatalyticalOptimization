Definition of Catalytical Sort

Definition of Catalytical Sort, in the tranditionary and ordinary processing of array sorting, 
Catalytism means a balanced peak avoid of RAM computing, means a Catalytical theory of reducing 
the ALUs, valuable sets, conditions, logic sections, function calls and prototypes.
The Accomplishment of Catalytical theory is an insufficiently condition to the next two steps 
of software DNA metabolism of functional logic and PDE(PDN Extension) secondary metabolism of 
metabase Initons encoding.

For proofs, TopSort5D
reducing the ALUs, Digital logics.
reducing the valuable sets, Memory optimizations.
reducing the conditions, Demorgan mathematics.
reducing the logic sections, Discrete mathematics.
reducing the function calls, Recuisive logics. Priority calls the high frequency logic sections as river flows.
reducing the prototypes. Inheritation logic.



Implements of Deta catalytic sort.
The raw marterial of Deta catalytic sort was Quicksort4D, 2009 from <<Introduction to Algorithms>>,
and its refer page: https://github.com/yaoguangluo/Data_Processor/blob/master/DP/sortProcessor/Quick_4D_Sort.java.

Its optimizations gradually became a catalytic sorting system. Such as left and right marching, 
inner and small peak filtering, defect peak induction, and discrete logic optimization etc. 

Left and right marching, a mainly in an asymmetric and unregular array, in order to find a symmetric
observation. The author separated main-array out of inner-array sections and where found a max value
between a Left prefix and right post-tail. Then did conditional performs to avoid the high peak of
computing. It seems much more important about reliabilities. 

Inner and small peak filtering, a mainly collections of high-effect algorithms, which in order to 
avoid problems such as the CPU lazy, net gate laggy, DMA crash and Memory out of stack.

Defect peak induction, a mainly problems induction, in an asymmetric and unregular statement. Meant
a butterfly effect of Defect computing problems about middle sets, values, functions and asserts.

Catalytic sets optimization, a mainly a collection of optimizations to reslove this defect computing
problems of above middle sets, values, functions and asserts.

Discrete logic optimization, a mainly a collection of algorithms to provide a catalytic optimization
about above middle sets, values, functions and asserts. These algorithms included Discrete Mathematics,
Demorgan Algebra, Objectives and Nature-Definitions.
