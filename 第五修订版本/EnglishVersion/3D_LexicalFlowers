Implements of 3-Dimensional DNN lexical flowers.
The 3-Dimensional and observational lexical flowers, where showed POS arrangement, PCA of 
text mining, and word segmentation. First input a text do the word segments, then did a
word statistics, and the Deta parser mind-read procedures, to find its DNN tokens, and 
rendered the PCA lexicons by each DNN token's score. Finally built a mapped result to respond
to the lexical flower's engine, YangLiaoJing, and prepare to show its 3-Dimensional 
demo-reflections by using JOGL 3D API. Not only the mapped result could be filtered by
scale vernier, also the rendered lexicons flower could be. The scale vernier could explain
more factors here the schedure controlled the amounts of lexicons, nodes of lexicons,
and classes of lexicons. Amounts of lexicons meant petal clusters under the same functional
lexicons, such like an umbrena, for example '轻身', '止渴', '明目'  under '苦参' etc. 
Nodes of lexicons meant a classification of the determinated attributes where expanded as 
a blooming flowers, for example '苦参'，'酒' etc. Classes of lexicons meant a whole layers
of this lexicon flower, for example '乌燕病名'. The scale vernier could make more procedures
of scheduring, filtering, abstracting and expanding etc.
