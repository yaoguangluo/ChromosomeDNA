An Implements of Ratio of POS. 
An Implements Ratio of POS. Mr. YaoguangLuo considered the ratio of POS which means the proportion of lexicons. 
For example their paper has 80 adjectives in 100 words, so the proportion of lexicon means that the essay contains
a lot of strokes, it more likes a prose. Of course, assumes their paper has 80 verbs in 100 words, so the
proportion of lexicon means that the essay contains a lot of actions, seems their essay more like a narrate.
Therefore, the author considered that ratios of POS could make a good descriptive activity, which to make a
prediction of a personal written grammar. Examples as below.

1. Implements a ratio of motivation. Assume their paper appears five words: Kitchen Knife, Chopping Board,
Wok, Streaky-Meat and Spicy-Condiment. Result a higher motivation of lexicons is cooking. It means the humanoid
computer could read and find a potential information from this paper, will easy to know this paper is about to
make a narrate of how to cook the food.

2. Implements a ratio of environment. Although their paper appears five words: Kitchen Knife, Chopping Board,
Wok, Streaky-Meat and Spicy-Condiment. Result a higher environment of lexicon is kitchen.  It means the humanoid
computer will easy to know this paper is about to cook a food in where the address is a Hotel, Canting, Caffeteria,
Pizzeria, Rosticerria or Restaurant.

3. Implements a ratio of literature. Even their paper still appears above five words. But result a higher ratio 
of POS is Noun. It means the humanoid computer will easy to know this paper is about a definite essay of Cooking
Science and Technology. 


An Implements of Distance of POS.
Mr. YaoguangLuo considered the distance of POS which means the weight of lexicons. Those factors about the 
reflection of different attributes and the position of different classes, which could make a calculation of Mind.
then continuing examples as below.
Assume their paper appears five words: Kitchen Knife, Chopping Board, Wok, Streaky-Meat and Spicy-Condiment. 
Result a higher frequency of lexical appearance, is Streaky-Meat. It means the humanoid computer could read and 
find a potencial information from this paper, will easy to know this paper is about a definite essay on Cooking 
Science and Technology, which mainly makes a presentation of meat. Similarly Result the higher frequency of lexical
appearance, is Spicy-Condiment. which mainly makes a presentation of Spicy-Formula. Lets continuing examples 
as below.

Assume their Spicy-Condiment contains a mature vinegar, which is a higher frequent lexicon. 'Vinegar' appears at 
paragraph of 1, 2, 4 and 5, especially at 4. the accomplishment of distance of the same lexicon, could scale the 
weight of 'Vinegar'. Then humanoid computer will easy to know this paper is about an essay of Cooking Science and 
Technology. which mainly an introduction of 'Vinegar' in presentation of Spicy-Formula. Especially at paragraph 4.

Euclidean KNN could trace an observation of frequent loxical distance. For example Deta RNN computings, Assumes it
sequently input 1'Vinegar', 2'Dumpling', 3'Vinegar' and 4'Streaky-Meat'，will result the Deta rank of DNN is higher
than Deta rank of RNN by 'Dumpling'. And also we could find that the Deta ratio of DNN of 'Streaky-Meat' is highly.
