An Implements of Ratio of POS. 

An Implements Ratio of POS. Mr. YaoguangLuo considered the ratio of POS which means the proportion of lexicons. 
For example their paper has 80 adjectives in 100 words, so the proportion of lexicon means that the essay contains
a lot of strokes, it more likes a prose. Of course, assumes their paper has 80 verbs in 100 words, so the
proportion of lexicon means that the essay contains a lot of actions, seems their essay more like a narrate.
Therefore, the author considered that ratios of POS could make a good descriptive activity, which to make a
prediction of a personal written grammar. Examples as below.

1. Implements a ratio of motivation. Assume their paper appears five words: Kitchen Knife, Chopping Board,
Wok, Streaky-Meat and Spicy-Condiment. Result a higher motivation of lexicons is cooking. It means the humanoid
computer could read and find a potential information from this paper, will easy to know this paper is about to
make a narrate of how to cook the food.

2. Implements a ratio of environment. Although their paper appears five words: Kitchen Knife, Chopping Board,
Wok, Streaky-Meat and Spicy-Condiment. Result a higher environment of lexicon is kitchen.  It means the humanoid
computer will easy to know this paper is about to cook a food in where the address is a Hotel, Canting, Caffeteria,
Pizzeria, Rosticerria or Restaurant.

3. Implements a ratio of literature. Even their paper still appears above five words. But result a higher ratio 
of POS is Noun. It means the humanoid computer will easy to know this paper is about a definite essay of Cooking
Science and Technology.
