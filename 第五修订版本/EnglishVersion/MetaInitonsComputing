I may get a conclusion that the DNA could be a flip-flops chain, where pre-locks the speech of signal function. 
The computing mode of RNA is a tupe mode of nero-network. mean not a command mode of cristal-driving. These modes 
of RNA build all kinds of actions by tupe combinations. For the listed eight structures, 1,2,3,4,6 of them could
build an extension link to change the stable frequency. According to the observation of two types of base-par:｛F, DU｝,｛F, IQ｝
, I may find a Biologially active where ｛F, DU｝ is smaller then ｛F, IQ｝.

Still meet a question here, to ensure the definition of CH3 in {UQ}. The author regards the actionable types of
RNA frequency, were based on tupe mode of nero-network , the computing mode of RNA is totally different with Desktop 
computer. means the tupe combinations of frequency, could build a lot of stressed actions. independent of the Cristal-shaking .

The author did a conclusion that the spiral link with DNA was used for functions storing, those informational functions 
executed a DNA-encoding. Once the link performs the RNA computing, the long link of DNA will separate the long link 
copy of RNA into a lot of shorter pieces of RNA. Due to the immutable environments, speeches, chemi-ionizations and 
reactions. The author considered the RNA computing was a combination of nero-networking and probable-scoring .
