A Detail of CE Separation in First Metabolism.

At first I input a functional file name as 'AOP.MVE.CSI.DUQ.java', the meta-based initons were from 'AOPM-VECS-IDUQ, 
DNA Initon Encoding'. Assumed above java file which had had three function prototypes of AOP(), AOP.MVE() and CSI(). 
then starts a metabolic optimization by their inherited interfaces. If we had learned C programming, will easy to make 
a separation between interfaces and prototypes. In an observation of metabolism, interface could be a macro type, 
and prototype could be a functional type. So by following C programming theory, we built Controller- C as macro type 
and Execute- E as functional type, it seems like a well condition of cuting the part of function name into file name 
after DNA Initon Encoding. And finally seems more like a blooming Dandelion flower. The author named this action as 
XCDX tail - first chars of 'XinChenDaiXie', metabolism. The first two line determinated a metabolic way of XCDX. And 
the end line did a comprehensively condition of static type.
