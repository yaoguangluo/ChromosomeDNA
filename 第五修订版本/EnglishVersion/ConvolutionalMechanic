Deta Java convolutional sobel algorithms and its applications.

The author mainly implemented four sobel attributes of concave, convex, gradient and vectors.
since he had been learned a sobel of 3-Dimentional distinction by calculation of Mag and Dir 
(magnitude and direction). The author developed RF infrared monitor by using Java CV at 2018,
to get the sensor catching. According to this experience, the author considered the ability of
Sobel algorithms, which belonged to a mechanics domain. Meant Sobel algorithm could explain a
randomness of chaos, a mere coincidence at here, computer vision of edge detection, could obviously 
do a well observation. Obsolutely the Mag and Dir of Sobel algorithm only just did a simple
procedure of 1 edge-detection and 2 vectorial portrait-sculpture here.

The author considered the magnitude of sobel, meant a squeeze pressure or tension in a mechanics
domain. And a direction could explain well of its regulation and pattern. these two factors
could calculate the arrangement of ray, distinction of winding-tension, and contrast of concave-convex.
To determinate the vector of 3D mechanics.

Promote on a higher layer of mechanic-computation. In case of mechanical separations from 
magnitude of sobel, which into a differential level, could explain well of stable status, fluidity
and inner phase. A question about asked by some one else: what and how does the connection
between mechanics and pixes? The author considered a pixes-picture in fact was a reflection of
energy pixes, the energies could transport to a mechanics. A higher ranged scales of sobel pixes
are, a higher entropy and energy-increment could be expressed. A merely show a simple way of 
pictures is a well edge detection on pictures.
