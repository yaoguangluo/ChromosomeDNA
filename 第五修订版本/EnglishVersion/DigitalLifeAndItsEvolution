Digital Life and Its Evolution

A new born of Deta big data programs. Mr.YaoguangLuo has been coding an expert system of medical education since 2018. 
recently it mainly emphasis a search, sort, word segmentation, DNN minding, vedio, prediction, statistics, memory swap,
shell script, Visional ETL and VPCS Web Service. The author named it 'YangLiaoJing', then continued to abstract the 
fundational API from those public functions, because the motivation of software is absolutely, is to build a self-SDLC 
metabolism, The author name it 'HuaRuiJi' API.  

Implements the Meta Base Initons of AOPM.
Mr.YaoguangLuo has learned <<Software Engineering>> at Chirst University, Bangalore, India, 2008, then used this technology
in so many projects at USA. Especially the model of waterfall (Ackquisition, Definition, Analyst, Process, DEV Code, Debug OPS,
Feedback and Optimization, Maintenance and Conclusion). The author began to abstract the heart point of those sets, for 
example Ackquisition, Definition and Analyst where could combine to A-analyst. DEV Code and Debug OPS where could combine
to O-operation. Feedback and Optimization where could combine to P-process. Maintenance and Conclusion where could combine
to M-management. Finally concluded from them as AOPM.

Implements the Meta Base Initons of VECS.
First time Mr.YaoguangLuo touched the MVC(Model View Controller)-model to build web business by using Hibernate, spring
MVC and Struts at ShangHai, China, 2009. At the same year touched the MVP(Model View Process)-model to build C# mobile 
service by using 32feet in Bluetooth business. Then try to separate C of MVC where into C-Controller unit and E-Execute 
unit, and then separated P of MVP where into E-Execute unit and S-StaticData unit. The author thought the Initon M of AOPM
also could be separated out V-Vision and H-Hall, Finally concluded from them as HVECS( AOPM contains a 'P' has already, 
duplicates a normalization, thus uses E instead P).

Implements the Meta Base Initons of IDUQ.
During the college days between the year of 2003 and 2013. Mr.YaoguangLuo had been studied a lot of professional credits
for Data instance <<Database Fundation>>(NAA), <<Database Management>>(Christ), << Introduction to Database >>(callutheran), 
<<Database System>>(Christ), <<Data Mining>>(callutheran), <<Adv Expert System>>(callutheran), <<Discrete Mathmatics>>(Christ),
<<COBOL74>>(Christ), <<Data Structure>>(Christ) and <<Digital Logic>>(Christ). Mr.YaoguangLuo found out that the data
manipulations mainly include four sets of IDUC Increment, Decrement, Update and Check. Finally concluded from them as IDUQ.
Changes the C of IDUC to Q-Query,( VECS contains a 'C' has already, duplicates a normalization, thus uses Q instead C).
Also the Accumulator of MCU is similar to this IDUQ architecture. 

Implements the Meta Base Initons of TXHF.
Mr.YaoguangLuo continuing to find more proofs of this meta base initons of AOPM-H-VECS-IDUQ, for exmple does a reflection
between DNA and nero cell, the author found out the gene relationships of ACGTI  which almost the same with SIDUQ. Then 
got out a fully proofs of PDN-Extension, PDE formula by using this DNA indexed meta-initons of Encode and Decode. Finally
got a new three actively meta-initons definition of TXF(T-Trigger, X-Xplore, F-Full). Finally concluded from them as <AOPM 
VECS IDUQ TXHF> and swap for a ouler TSP Hexdecimal <DCPE THOS MAXF IDUQ>.

DCPE THOS MAXF VIUQ, a Hexdecimal-Initon Encode.
Mr.YaoguangLuo has been continuing to make a duplication and normalization since did out PDN Extension and DNA Hexdecimal-Initon
encode and decode. For example in the indexed software files and function names where to do the metabolism. The author 
made a classification of Hexdecimal-Initon as {A-VECS, A-IDUQ, O-VECS P-VECS. . . I-AOPM, I-VECS, . . . Q- VECS}.  and then
made a function list to static its API collections, such as a calling flower. it contains 24 petals, petals also could be 
named 'Chromosomes' here.  those functions could be target as an arrangement of sequence call number, the number could be 
attributes, inherits and genes etc. Not only this indexed sequence call number could do PDN-Extensions and informational 
storages. mean it also could be an event recording of humanoid theory. 

The author considered it as a truly life, 'Software Life'.
