Implements of VPCS server notes on Gitee.
In an early time of author's projects, MVC backend was a popular solution for
web development. And the first MVP project of IOS game:
https://github.com/yaoguangluo/dark-wizard-game/tree/master/DOW2
, the author appreciated its object oriented schedures and its refreshment. Due to the
MVC was too heavy, so the author did a definition of game controllers. And finally separated 
the macros and prototypes as a type of MVPC. Since the author did a Java test job at 
Folsom Intel, after he used Java mockito MVC API, mixed with Junit4 to make a springboot
and hibernate test. He found that all functions could be tested as a single process, and
this process contained a classify of schedures. These schedures included sinletons, sonar
spells, spring web boots and spring injects. And these schedures were tested one by one
like a time sequenced line-waterflows. So the test process before deployment which was a 
synchronization, but the true of its inner schedures were an asynchronization. The author
took more questions about sonar qube registrations because those contained lots unforeseeably
encrypt dlls. The author try to explain well between asynchronization and synchronization 
by reading the professional book of Operating System, TCP/IP, Software Engineering and How
to programming. After he did a simulation by using CGI, Moonguse C, Rust and Golang etc. 
Then he got a result of TCP hands shaking and time sequenced Rest-calling. He became to know
the asynchronization distincts to synchronization. Then annouced a first 'VPC' at 
https://github.com/yaoguangluo/VPC5.0/commit/dc06dbc3750879155871d45ce9cdb8be29825a60, 
2017年10月19日 GMT+8 12:15. Because of his VPC project, was built by springboot and mybatis,
which was unforeseeably. The author couldn't test and catch the question well, then try to 
code a new bottom OSI layer of rest call allocations about his theory of VPC. He began to 
think about camel rpc, golang grpc, TCP rxtx hands shaking, RS485, powerlink flips and modbus
hands shaking. Finally, the author used SSH Sockets to simulate the hands shaking CGI. After
he had simulated an iluwatar handler-schedures, he got so many effeciency problems of memory
garbage, unused performs and dead locks. Then he try to make separations of data and logics, 
schedures and resource, business and controllers. And now the VPC became a VPCS, VECS of AOPM
VECS IDUQ TXHF, a part of Deta DNA hexadecimal meta base initons. For the listed bee coords 
classify of 'Swarm Computing' at chapter 6 and DNA AOPM-VPCS catalytic computing-array at 
chapter 7. The author used socket flows of hands shaking, to instead springboot and mybatis,
the author did an affordable Deta PLSQL, to instead MYSQL. and now he prepared to make a new 
separation of ethics and computings.
